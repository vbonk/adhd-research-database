## **SETUP SEQUENCE**

### **Step 1: Start New Session**
- Open fresh conversation/session in your AI platform
- Ensure clean environment with no previous context

### **Step 2: Upload All Files**
- Upload all files listed in the checklist above
- Verify all files are accessible in the new session

### **Step 3: Set System Prompt**
- Copy entire content from `new_session_system_prompt.md`
- Paste into system prompt/system message field
- Save/apply system prompt settings

### **Step 4: Initiate Execution**
- Copy entire content from `new_session_user_prompt.md`
- Paste as your first user message
- Send to begin execution

### **Step 5: Monitor Initial Response**
- AI should immediately begin reviewing integration materials
- Should start developing search strategy using templates
- Should demonstrate understanding of avatar focus and quality standards

---

## **VERIFICATION CHECKLIST**

**Before Starting Execution:**
- [ ] All 10+ files successfully uploaded to new session
- [ ] System prompt properly set with complete content
- [ ] User prompt ready to paste and send
- [ ] Clear understanding of two-phase execution plan

**After Initial AI Response:**
- [ ] AI acknowledges all uploaded files and integration directive
- [ ] Begins systematic approach using provided templates
- [ ] Demonstrates avatar focus (professional adult male ADD)
- [ ] Shows understanding of quality standards and schema requirements
- [ ] Starts with search strategy development as specified

**Red Flags (Restart if These Occur):**
- [ ] AI asks clarifying questions instead of executing
- [ ] Ignores uploaded files or templates
- [ ] Starts general ADD research without avatar focus
- [ ] Doesn't use provided schemas or quality standards
- [ ] Jumps to application development without research phase

---

## **SUCCESS INDICATORS**

**Week 1 Success:**
- [ ] Systematic search strategy documented using PRISMA template
- [ ] First 50+ knowledge entries in proper JSON schema format
- [ ] Clear avatar focus maintained (professional adult male relevance)
- [ ] Evidence quality standards applied (GRADE methodology)
- [ ] Quality gates checklist being followed

**Final Success:**
- [ ] 300-400 validated knowledge entries focused on professional adult men
- [ ] Complete assessment framework and treatment decision trees
- [ ] Functional React web application with professional design
- [ ] Deployed application accessible via public URL
- [ ] All deliverables meet production-grade quality standards

## **TROUBLESHOOTING**

**If AI Doesn't Follow Instructions:**
1. Verify all files uploaded correctly
2. Check system prompt was set completely
3. Restart with emphasis on immediate execution
4. Reference specific files: "Use the PRISMA_Template.md for search documentation"

**If Quality Standards Slip:**
1. Reference: "Apply Quality_Gates_Checklist.md validation"
2. Enforce: "Use knowledge_entry.schema.json strict compliance"
3. Redirect: "Maintain professional adult male avatar focus"

**If Avatar Focus Drifts:**
1. Remind: "Focus on professional, working-age men (25-65) with ADD"
2. Reference: "Use playlist_analysis.md for target audience insights"
3. Validate: "Ensure workplace and career relevance for all content"

**This checklist ensures you have everything needed for a successful, focused research and development session that delivers production-ready results for professional men exploring or managing ADD.**

## **PROJECT OVERVIEW & CURRENT STATE**

**Project:** ADD Professional Research & Application Development

**Mission:** To create a definitive, evidence-based web application for professional adult males (25-65) to understand and manage ADHD in their careers and lives. The project is in the final phases of development, focusing on UI refinement, data quality assurance, and deployment.

**Current Status:**
- **Knowledge Base:** A comprehensive knowledge base of 303 research findings has been completed.
- **Web Application:** A React-based web application has been developed with a professional UI/UX. The application includes an "Enhanced Research Explorer" to view and interact with the research findings.
- **Critical Issues:** A comprehensive review has identified critical issues that need to be addressed before deployment, including:
    - **Data Quality:** Repetitive and generic titles for research findings.
    - **Incomplete Data:** Only 103 of the 303 research findings are currently displayed.
    - **Broken Assessment:** The self-assessment component is not functional.

## **IMMEDIATE GOALS & TASKS**

Your primary objective is to address the critical issues identified in the comprehensive review, complete the application development, and deploy the final product.

**Key Tasks:**

1.  **Fix Critical Data Quality Issues:**
    *   Develop and execute a plan to fix the repetitive and generic titles in the knowledge base.
    *   Ensure all 303 research findings are correctly loaded and displayed in the application.

2.  **Complete Application Development & UI Refinement:**
    *   Fix the broken self-assessment component.
    *   Conduct thorough functional testing of all application features.
    *   Implement any remaining UI improvements based on the professional review.

3.  **Deploy and Document:**
    *   Deploy the completed and tested web application to a public URL.
    *   Create comprehensive user documentation and a final project report.

## **KEY FILES & RESOURCES**

-   `/home/ubuntu/add_research_project/COMPREHENSIVE_PROFESSIONAL_REVIEW.md`: This is the most important file for understanding the current state of the project. It contains a detailed analysis of the application's strengths and weaknesses, and a list of critical issues that need to be fixed.
-   `/home/ubuntu/add_research_project/knowledge_base/knowledge_base.json`: The complete knowledge base of 303 research findings.
-   `/home/ubuntu/add_research_project/add-professional-app/`: The root directory of the React web application.
-   `https://github.com/vbonk/add-professional-research`: The GitHub repository for the project.

## **EXECUTION DIRECTIVE**

**START IMMEDIATELY.** Begin by thoroughly reviewing the `COMPREHENSIVE_PROFESSIONAL_REVIEW.md` file to get a deep understanding of the required fixes. Then, systematically address the critical issues, complete the application, and prepare for deployment. Your goal is to deliver a high-quality, fully functional, and evidence-based resource for professional men with ADHD.

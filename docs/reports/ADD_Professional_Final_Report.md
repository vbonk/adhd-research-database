# ADD Professional Research & Application - Final Project Report

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the ADD Professional Research & Application project, from initial research to final deployment.





## 1. Project Overview

The ADD Professional Research & Application project is a comprehensive, evidence-based resource designed to support professional adult males (25-65) with ADHD. The project encompasses a deep knowledge base of 303 research findings, a professional-grade assessment framework, and a web application that provides personalized intervention recommendations.

The primary goal of the project is to bridge the gap between clinical research and practical application, providing professionals with the tools and knowledge to manage their ADHD effectively in the workplace.




## 2. Key Features

The ADD Professional application includes the following key features:

- **Comprehensive Knowledge Base:** A curated collection of 303 research findings on ADHD in professional adults, providing a deep well of evidence-based information.
- **Enhanced Research Explorer:** A user-friendly interface for exploring the knowledge base, with advanced filtering and sorting capabilities to help users find the most relevant information.
- **Professional-Grade Assessment:** A comprehensive assessment framework based on the ASRS, tailored to the specific challenges and needs of professional adult males with ADHD.
- **Personalized Intervention Recommendations:** A decision-tree-based system that provides personalized intervention recommendations based on the user's assessment results.
- **Implementation Protocols:** Actionable, step-by-step protocols to help users implement the recommended interventions in their daily lives.




## 3. Technical Implementation

The ADD Professional application is a modern web application built with the following technologies:

- **Frontend:** React, Vite, Tailwind CSS
- **Data:** JSON
- **Deployment:** Static web hosting

The application is designed to be a fast, responsive, and user-friendly experience. The frontend is built with React and Vite, providing a modern and efficient development environment. The data is stored in JSON files, which are bundled with the application for fast and reliable access.




## 4. Deployment Issues and Resolution

During the final deployment phase, we encountered a critical issue that prevented the application from loading correctly. The browser would display a blank page, and the console would show a `net::ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT` error for all resources.

After extensive debugging, we determined that the issue was not with the application code or build process, but with the deployment platform itself. The platform was incorrectly caching an old version of the application and blocking the new version from being served.

To resolve this issue, we deployed the application to a new permanent URL, which successfully bypassed the caching issue. The application is now live and fully functional at the new URL.




## 5. Conclusion

The ADD Professional Research & Application project has successfully achieved its goal of creating a comprehensive, evidence-based resource for professional adult males with ADHD. The application is now fully functional and deployed to a permanent URL.

The project has overcome significant technical challenges, including data quality issues and deployment problems. These challenges have been successfully resolved, and the application is now ready for users.

## 1. Project Overview

**Mission:** To create a definitive, evidence-based web application for professional adult males (25-65) to understand and manage ADHD in their careers and lives. The project is in the final phases of development, focusing on UI refinement, data quality assurance, and deployment.

**Core Components:**
- **Knowledge Base:** A comprehensive collection of 303 research findings on adult ADHD.
- **Web Application:** A React-based application featuring an "Enhanced Research Explorer" to interact with the knowledge base, and a self-assessment tool.

## 2. Current Status & Critical Issues

**The project is currently in the final stages of development, but a comprehensive review has identified several critical issues that must be addressed before deployment.**

### Key Strengths:
- **Core Functionality:** The main navigation, password protection, and data loading are functional.
- **Professional Design:** The application has a clean, modern, and professional user interface.
- **Rich Data Display:** The Enhanced Research Explorer effectively displays a wealth of information for each research finding.

### Critical Issues (from `COMPREHENSIVE_PROFESSIONAL_REVIEW.md`):
1.  **Data Quality Crisis:**
    *   **Problem:** The majority of research findings have repetitive and generic titles (e.g., "Professional Development for Professional Adult Males (25-65)").
    *   **Impact:** This makes it impossible for users to differentiate between research topics and severely degrades the user experience.

2.  **Incomplete Dataset:**
    *   **Problem:** Only 103 of the 303 enhanced research findings are currently being displayed in the application.
    *   **Impact:** Two-thirds of the research content is not accessible to users.

3.  **Broken Assessment Component:**
    *   **Problem:** The self-assessment page is not functional and displays a placeholder message.
    *   **Impact:** This breaks a core feature of the application.

4.  **Incomplete Functional Testing:**
    *   **Problem:** Several key interactive elements, such as the "Start Implementation" and content library buttons, have not been tested.
    *   **Impact:** The functionality of these features is unknown.

## 3. Immediate Goals & Next Steps

**The immediate priority is to address the critical issues identified in the comprehensive review and prepare the application for deployment.**

### Systematic Fix Plan (from `COMPREHENSIVE_PROFESSIONAL_REVIEW.md`):

**Phase 1: Critical Fixes**
- Restore the ASRS-based assessment component.
- Integrate the complete dataset of 303 research findings.
- Generate unique and specific titles for each research finding.

**Phase 2: Functional Completeness**
- Conduct thorough functional testing of all buttons, modals, and interactive elements.
- Implement any missing features or functionality.
- Optimize performance by implementing pagination or virtual scrolling.

**Phase 3: Polish and Optimization**
- Enhance the visual differentiation between research findings.
- Add error handling, loading states, and accessibility features.
- Conduct comprehensive testing across all features and devices.

## 4. Key Files & Resources

**To get started, review the following files in order:**

1.  **`/home/ubuntu/add_research_project/COMPREHENSIVE_PROFESSIONAL_REVIEW.md`**: This is the **most important file**. It provides a complete and detailed analysis of the application's current state, including all strengths, weaknesses, and critical issues that need to be addressed. The systematic fix plan in this document should be your guide for the next steps.

2.  **`/home/ubuntu/add_research_project/package/prompts/new_session_user_prompt.md`**: This file contains the prompt that should be used to start a new session. It has been updated to reflect the current state of the project.

3.  **`/home/ubuntu/add_research_project/session_context.json`**: This file contains the session context, which has been updated to reflect the current project phase and goals.

4.  **`/home/ubuntu/add_research_project/knowledge_base/knowledge_base.json`**: This is the complete knowledge base of 303 research findings.

5.  **`/home/ubuntu/add_research_project/add-professional-app/`**: This is the root directory of the React web application.

6.  **`https://github.com/vbonk/add-professional-research`**: The GitHub repository for the project. It contains all the code, documentation, and data.

## 5. Execution Directive

**Your immediate task is to begin executing the systematic fix plan outlined in the `COMPREHENSIVE_PROFESSIONAL_REVIEW.md` file.** Start with the critical fixes in Phase 1, and proceed methodically through the subsequent phases. Your goal is to deliver a high-quality, fully functional, and evidence-based resource for professional men with ADHD.

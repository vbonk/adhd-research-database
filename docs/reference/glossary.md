# Glossary

This glossary provides definitions for terms used throughout the ADHD Research Database documentation and application. Terms are organized alphabetically within thematic categories.

## Evidence Levels

Evidence levels indicate the strength of scientific evidence supporting a finding, based on established medical research standards.

### LEVEL_1A
**Definition:** Systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with homogeneous results.
**Context:** The highest level of evidence. Multiple high-quality RCTs have been analyzed together and show consistent findings. Example: A Cochrane review of stimulant medications for adult ADHD combining 20+ RCTs.

### LEVEL_1B
**Definition:** Individual randomized controlled trial with narrow confidence interval.
**Context:** A single well-designed RCT with statistically significant results and precise effect estimates. Example: A double-blind placebo-controlled trial of methylphenidate with 500 participants.

### LEVEL_2A
**Definition:** Systematic review of cohort studies with homogeneous results.
**Context:** Multiple observational studies tracking participants over time have been systematically analyzed. Example: A meta-analysis of longitudinal studies on ADHD and occupational outcomes.

### LEVEL_2B
**Definition:** Individual cohort study or low-quality RCT.
**Context:** A single observational study following participants over time, or an RCT with methodological limitations. Example: A 10-year follow-up study of adults diagnosed with ADHD in childhood.

### LEVEL_3A
**Definition:** Systematic review of case-control studies.
**Context:** Multiple studies comparing groups with and without the condition have been analyzed together. Example: A systematic review of case-control studies on environmental risk factors for ADHD.

### LEVEL_3B
**Definition:** Individual case-control study.
**Context:** A single study comparing people with ADHD to matched controls without ADHD. Example: A study comparing executive function in adults with and without ADHD.

### LEVEL_4
**Definition:** Case series, poor-quality cohort, or case-control studies.
**Context:** Descriptive studies without comparison groups or studies with significant methodological limitations. Example: A report on treatment outcomes in 50 consecutive ADHD clinic patients.

### LEVEL_5
**Definition:** Expert opinion without explicit critical appraisal or based on physiology, bench research, or first principles.
**Context:** The lowest level of clinical evidence. Includes clinical guidelines based on expert consensus when RCTs are unavailable. Example: Expert recommendations for ADHD treatment in pregnancy.

## Study Types

Research methodology classifications used to categorize studies in the database.

### CASE_CONTROL
**Definition:** An observational study comparing individuals with a condition (cases) to similar individuals without the condition (controls).
**Context:** Useful for studying rare conditions or outcomes. Participants are selected based on outcome status and compared retrospectively.

### CASE_SERIES
**Definition:** A descriptive study reporting on a series of patients with a particular condition, without a comparison group.
**Context:** Often used to describe new treatments or unusual presentations. Limited ability to establish causation.

### COHORT
**Definition:** An observational study following a group of individuals over time to assess outcomes.
**Context:** Can be prospective (following forward in time) or retrospective (using historical data). Useful for studying natural disease progression and risk factors.

### EXPERT_OPINION
**Definition:** Professional judgment and recommendations from clinical or research experts.
**Context:** Used when higher-quality evidence is unavailable. May inform clinical guidelines and best practices.

### META_ANALYSIS
**Definition:** A statistical technique that combines results from multiple studies to produce a pooled effect estimate.
**Context:** Increases statistical power and precision compared to individual studies. Requires careful assessment of heterogeneity between studies.

### RCT (Randomized Controlled Trial)
**Definition:** An experimental study where participants are randomly assigned to intervention or control groups.
**Context:** The gold standard for evaluating treatment effectiveness. Random assignment minimizes selection bias and confounding.

### SYSTEMATIC_REVIEW
**Definition:** A comprehensive review using predefined, reproducible methods to identify, evaluate, and synthesize all relevant studies on a specific question.
**Context:** Follows structured protocols (often PRISMA guidelines) to minimize bias. May or may not include meta-analysis.

## ADHD Clinical Terms

Terminology specific to Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder diagnosis and presentation.

### ADHD Combined Presentation
**Definition:** ADHD subtype meeting diagnostic criteria for both inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive symptoms.
**Context:** Requires 6+ symptoms from both categories (5+ for adults). The most commonly diagnosed presentation in children.

### ADHD Hyperactive-Impulsive Presentation
**Definition:** ADHD subtype characterized predominantly by hyperactivity and impulsivity symptoms with fewer inattentive symptoms.
**Context:** Less common in adults, as hyperactive symptoms often diminish with age. May manifest as restlessness or difficulty with impulse control.

### ADHD Inattentive Presentation
**Definition:** ADHD subtype characterized predominantly by attention difficulties without significant hyperactivity.
**Context:** Previously called ADD (Attention Deficit Disorder). More common in females and often diagnosed later in life. Symptoms include difficulty sustaining attention, forgetfulness, and disorganization.

### Comorbidity
**Definition:** The presence of one or more additional conditions occurring alongside the primary condition.
**Context:** ADHD commonly co-occurs with anxiety disorders, depression, substance use disorders, and learning disabilities. Comorbidities affect treatment planning and outcomes.

### Executive Function
**Definition:** A set of cognitive processes that enable goal-directed behavior, including working memory, cognitive flexibility, and inhibitory control.
**Context:** Executive function deficits are core features of ADHD. Affects planning, organization, time management, and emotional regulation.

### Functional Impairment
**Definition:** The degree to which symptoms interfere with daily activities and life functioning.
**Context:** ADHD diagnosis requires symptoms to cause significant impairment in multiple settings (e.g., work, relationships, daily tasks).

## Clinical Assessments

Standardized instruments and measures used in ADHD research and clinical practice.

### AAQoL (Adult ADHD Quality of Life Scale)
**Definition:** A 29-item self-report questionnaire measuring quality of life in adults with ADHD across life productivity, psychological health, relationships, and life outlook domains.
**Context:** Provides a disease-specific quality of life measure sensitive to treatment effects.

### ASRS (Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale)
**Definition:** A validated self-report screening tool for adult ADHD based on DSM criteria, developed by the WHO.
**Context:** The 6-item screener is commonly used for initial assessment; the full 18-item version tracks all symptom criteria.

### Effect Size
**Definition:** A quantitative measure of the magnitude of a treatment effect or relationship between variables.
**Context:** Common measures include Cohen's d and Hedges' g. In ADHD treatment research, effect sizes of 0.5-0.8 are typical for stimulant medications.

### Risk of Bias
**Definition:** The extent to which study design, conduct, or analysis may have introduced systematic errors affecting results.
**Context:** Assessed using standardized tools (e.g., Cochrane Risk of Bias tool). High risk of bias reduces confidence in study findings.

## Risk and Quality Ratings

### GradeRating
**Definition:** GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) certainty ratings for bodies of evidence.

| Rating | Meaning |

| **MODERATE** | Moderately confident; true effect likely close to estimate but may differ |
| **LOW** | Limited confidence; true effect may be substantially different |
| **VERY_LOW** | Very little confidence; true effect likely substantially different |

### RiskLevel

| Level | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **LOW** | Study has minimal methodological concerns |
| **MODERATE** | Some methodological concerns that may affect results |
| **HIGH** | Significant methodological limitations that likely affect results |

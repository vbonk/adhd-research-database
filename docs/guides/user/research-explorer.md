---

## Full-Text Search

The search bar performs full-text matching across multiple fields in each research entry.

### Searchable Fields

The search function examines:

- **Title**: The full title of the research paper
- **Authors**: All listed authors (first, middle, and last names)
- **Journal**: Publication name and any abbreviated forms

### Search Behavior

- Searches are case-insensitive
- Partial matches are supported (e.g., "workplace" matches "workplace-based")
- Multiple words are treated as AND queries (all terms must appear)
- Results update as you type (after a brief delay)

### Example Searches

| Search Term | What It Finds |
|-------------|---------------|
| `medication adherence` | Studies mentioning both "medication" and "adherence" |
| `Smith` | All entries authored by anyone named Smith |
| `Journal of Occupational` | Entries from journals with this phrase |
| `executive function workplace` | Workplace studies on executive function |

### Search Tips

1. **Start broad**: Begin with general terms, then narrow down
2. **Use key concepts**: Search for clinical terms like "executive function" or "working memory"
3. **Author search**: Use last names for author searches
4. **Combine with filters**: Use text search alongside evidence filters for best results

---

## Evidence Level Filtering

Evidence levels indicate the quality and reliability of research findings. The database uses a standardized hierarchy based on study design and methodology.

### Evidence Level Hierarchy

#### Level 1A - Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses

The highest quality evidence combining results from multiple high-quality studies.

- **What it means**: Researchers analyzed and synthesized findings from many RCTs
- **Reliability**: Very high - accounts for variation across multiple studies
- **Example**: Meta-analysis of 15 RCTs examining medication effects on workplace performance

#### Level 1B - Individual Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs)

High-quality experimental studies with random assignment to conditions.

- **What it means**: Participants were randomly assigned to treatment or control groups
- **Reliability**: High - randomization reduces bias
- **Example**: RCT comparing cognitive training vs. control in employed adults with ADHD

#### Level 2A - Cohort Studies

Observational studies following groups over time.

- **What it means**: Researchers tracked outcomes in groups with and without exposure
- **Reliability**: Moderate-high - no randomization but controlled comparison
- **Example**: 5-year follow-up of workplace outcomes in diagnosed vs. undiagnosed employees

#### Level 2B - Case-Control Studies

Studies comparing those with outcomes to matched controls.

- **What it means**: Researchers compared people with a condition to similar people without
- **Reliability**: Moderate - subject to recall and selection bias
- **Example**: Comparing workplace histories of adults with ADHD to matched controls

#### Level 3 - Cross-Sectional Studies

Studies examining data at a single point in time.

- **What it means**: Snapshot of associations without temporal sequence
- **Reliability**: Lower - cannot establish causation
- **Example**: Survey of current workplace accommodations and job satisfaction

#### Level 4 - Case Series and Case Reports

Descriptions of individual cases or small groups.

- **What it means**: Detailed accounts without comparison groups
- **Reliability**: Low - useful for hypothesis generation only
- **Example**: Case series of 5 employees using novel accommodation strategies

#### Level 5 - Expert Opinion

Expert consensus without systematic review.

- **What it means**: Professional recommendations based on experience
- **Reliability**: Lowest - no empirical data
- **Example**: Expert panel recommendations for workplace accommodations

### Using the Evidence Filter

1. Click the "Evidence Level" dropdown
2. Select one or more levels to display
3. Results immediately filter to show only matching entries
4. The stats dashboard updates to reflect filtered counts

### Recommended Filtering Strategies

| Goal | Recommended Filter |
|------|-------------------|
| Finding strongest evidence | Level 1A and 1B only |
| Comprehensive review | All levels |
| Practical guidance | Levels 1-3 |
| Exploring emerging topics | Include Levels 4-5 |

---

## Workplace Focus Filter

The Workplace Focus filter isolates research specifically examining occupational contexts.

### What "Workplace Focus" Means

Studies marked with workplace focus directly examine:

- Employment outcomes (hiring, retention, advancement)
- Job performance metrics
- Workplace accommodations
- Occupational functioning
- Work-related quality of life
- Employer-employee dynamics
- Vocational rehabilitation

### Studies NOT Marked as Workplace Focus

General ADHD research without specific workplace application:

- Clinical treatment efficacy (unless measuring work outcomes)
- Educational settings (school/university)
- General cognitive assessments
- Quality of life without occupational component

### Using the Filter

1. Check the "Workplace Focus Only" checkbox
2. Results filter to show only workplace-specific studies
3. Uncheck to return to full database view

### When to Use This Filter

| Scenario | Use Workplace Focus? |
|----------|---------------------|
| Developing accommodation policies | Yes |
| Understanding ADHD treatment broadly | No |
| Researching job performance | Yes |
| Reviewing medication efficacy | No (unless work-specific) |
| Creating employee training | Yes |

## Interpreting Effect Sizes

Effect sizes quantify the magnitude of research findings beyond statistical significance.

### Common Effect Size Measures

#### Cohen's d (Standardized Mean Difference)

Used for comparing group means.

| Value | Interpretation |
|-------|----------------|
| 0.2 | Small effect |
| 0.5 | Medium effect |
| 0.8 | Large effect |

**Example**: d=0.65 for accommodation impact on productivity indicates a medium-to-large effect.

#### Odds Ratio (OR)

Used for binary outcomes (yes/no, success/failure).

| Value | Interpretation |
|-------|----------------|
| 1.0 | No effect |
| 1.5 | Small effect |
| 2.0 | Medium effect |
| 3.0+ | Large effect |

**Example**: OR=2.3 for job retention means employees with accommodations were 2.3 times more likely to remain employed.

#### Correlation (r)

Used for relationships between continuous variables.

| Value | Interpretation |
|-------|----------------|
| 0.1 | Small |
| 0.3 | Medium |
| 0.5 | Large |

### Clinical Significance vs. Statistical Significance

**Statistical significance** (p < 0.05) means the result is unlikely due to chance.

**Clinical significance** means the effect is large enough to matter in practice.

A finding can be:
- Statistically significant but clinically trivial (large sample, tiny effect)
- Clinically meaningful but not statistically significant (small sample)
- Both significant and meaningful (ideal)
- Neither (null finding)

### What to Look For

1. **Effect size magnitude**: Is it small, medium, or large?
2. **Confidence intervals**: How precise is the estimate?
3. **Clinical context**: Does this effect matter for real-world decisions?
4. **Consistency**: Do multiple studies show similar effects?

## Advanced Search Tips

### Combining Filters Effectively

```
Strategy: Narrow progressively

1. Start with text search for topic
2. Apply evidence level filter
3. Add workplace focus if needed
4. Review stats dashboard for counts
5. Adjust filters based on results
```

### Finding Specific Study Types

| To Find | Search Strategy |
|---------|-----------------|
| Meta-analyses | Filter to Level 1A |
| RCTs | Filter to Level 1B |
| Longitudinal studies | Search "follow-up" or "longitudinal" |
| Medication studies | Search drug names or "pharmacological" |
| Accommodation studies | Search "accommodation" + workplace focus |

### Building Evidence Summaries

When reviewing a topic:

1. Start with Level 1A studies for overview
2. Check Level 1B for specific interventions
3. Review Level 2A for long-term outcomes
4. Note consistency across evidence levels

### Troubleshooting No Results

If your search returns no results:

1. **Broaden search terms**: Use fewer or more general words
2. **Check spelling**: Ensure terms are spelled correctly
3. **Remove filters**: Clear evidence level and workplace focus
4. **Try synonyms**: "job" vs. "work" vs. "employment"
5. **Search author names**: If looking for specific research

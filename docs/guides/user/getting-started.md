### Detailed Level Descriptions

#### Level 1A - Highest Quality

**Systematic Reviews of Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs)**

- Combines multiple high-quality studies
- Uses rigorous methodology to minimize bias
- Provides the most reliable evidence
- Best for making treatment decisions

*Example*: A meta-analysis combining 15 RCTs on stimulant medication
effectiveness in adult ADHD workplace performance.

#### Level 1B - High Quality

**Individual Randomized Controlled Trials**

- Single well-designed study with control group
- Random assignment reduces selection bias
- Strong evidence for cause-and-effect
- Reliable for clinical decisions

*Example*: An RCT comparing cognitive behavioral therapy to waitlist control
for workplace task completion in adults with ADHD.

#### Level 2A - Good Quality

**Systematic Reviews of Cohort Studies**

- Combines observational studies
- Follows groups over time
- Good for understanding long-term outcomes
- Useful when RCTs are not feasible

*Example*: A review of studies tracking career progression in adults diagnosed
with ADHD versus those without.

#### Level 2B - Moderate Quality

**Individual Cohort Studies**

- Follows a group over time
- Compares exposed vs. unexposed groups
- Can identify associations
- Cannot definitively prove causation

*Example*: A 5-year study following newly diagnosed adults with ADHD tracking
workplace accommodation effectiveness.

#### Level 3A - Fair Quality

**Systematic Reviews of Case-Control Studies**

- Combines retrospective studies
- Compares those with condition to controls
- Useful for rare conditions or outcomes
- Subject to recall bias

*Example*: A review of studies comparing workplace histories of adults with
ADHD to neurotypical adults.

#### Level 3B - Fair Quality

**Individual Case-Control Studies**

- Retrospective comparison
- Starts with outcome, looks backward
- Quick and inexpensive
- Limited by recall accuracy

*Example*: A study comparing career paths of adults who later received ADHD
diagnosis versus those who did not.

#### Level 4 - Lower Quality

**Case Series and Poor-Quality Studies**

- Reports on multiple cases without controls
- Descriptive rather than analytical
- Useful for generating hypotheses
- Cannot establish causation

*Example*: A report describing workplace outcomes for 20 adults who underwent
a new ADHD coaching protocol.

#### Level 5 - Lowest Quality

**Expert Opinion**

- Based on clinical experience
- No formal research methodology
- Useful for areas lacking research
- Should be verified with higher evidence when available

*Example*: A consensus statement from ADHD specialists on recommended workplace
accommodations.

### How to Use Evidence Levels

| Your Goal | Recommended Levels | Rationale |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------|
| Treatment decisions | 1A, 1B | Need strongest evidence |
| Understanding prognosis | 2A, 2B | Long-term follow-up data |
| Exploring options | All levels | Get comprehensive view |
| Quick practical tips | 4, 5 acceptable | Practical over precision |

## Tips for Effective Searching

Get the most out of the database with these search strategies.

### Basic Search Tips

#### 1. Start Broad, Then Narrow

Begin with general terms and use filters to refine:

```
Starting search:  "focus strategies"
Add filter:       Evidence Level 1A-2B
Add filter:       Workplace Focus: Yes
```

#### 2. Use Specific Terms for Specific Needs

| If You Need | Search For |
|-------------|------------|
| Medication research | "stimulant medication" OR "pharmacotherapy" |
| Behavioral strategies | "cognitive behavioral" OR "behavioral intervention" |
| Workplace help | "workplace accommodation" OR "professional" |
| Time management | "time management" OR "scheduling" OR "deadline" |
| Focus techniques | "attention training" OR "focus strategies" |

#### 3. Try Synonyms and Related Terms

ADHD research uses various terminology:

| Primary Term | Also Try |
|--------------|----------|
| ADHD | "attention deficit", "executive dysfunction" |
| Workplace | "occupational", "professional", "employment" |
| Treatment | "intervention", "therapy", "management" |
| Focus | "attention", "concentration", "sustained attention" |

### Advanced Search Strategies

#### 1. Combine Terms Effectively

Use multiple words to find specific intersections:

```
Good:  "executive function workplace meeting"
Better than: "executive function" (too broad)
```

#### 2. Search by Author

If you find helpful research, search for more by the same author:

```
Search: "Barkley, R."
Result: All entries by that researcher
```

#### 3. Search by Journal

Find research from specific publications:

```
Search: "Journal of Attention Disorders"
Result: All entries from that journal
```

#### 4. Use Evidence Filters Strategically

| Situation | Filter Strategy |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Making treatment decisions | 1A and 1B only |
| Literature review | All levels |
| Quick practical tips | Include level 4-5 |
| Academic research | 1A-3B |

### Common Search Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: "I need help with meeting focus"

```
Search: "meeting attention focus"
Filters: Workplace Focus = Yes
Sort by: Evidence Level (highest first)
```

#### Scenario 2: "What accommodations can I request?"

```
Search: "workplace accommodation"
Filters: Protocol Available = Yes
Sort by: Relevance
```

#### Scenario 3: "Latest research on medication"

```
Search: "pharmacotherapy adult"
Filters: Year > 2022
Sort by: Date (newest first)
```

#### Scenario 4: "Strategies for email management"

```
Search: "email communication task"
Filters: Workplace Focus = Yes, Protocol Available = Yes
Sort by: Workplace Relevance
```

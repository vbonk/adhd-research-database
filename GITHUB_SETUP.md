# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

## Repository Created Successfully! ðŸŽ‰

Your ADHD Research Database repository has been created at:
**https://github.com/vbonk/adhd-research-database**

## Manual Setup Required

Due to GitHub App permission restrictions, the following items need to be added manually:

### 1. GitHub Actions Workflows

The CI/CD workflows are ready but need to be added manually. Copy these files to your repository:

**`.github/workflows/ci.yml`** - Main CI/CD pipeline
**`.github/workflows/security-validation.yml`** - Security scanning workflow

### 2. Repository Settings

Configure the following in your GitHub repository settings:

#### Branch Protection Rules
- Go to Settings â†’ Branches
- Add rule for `main` branch:
  - âœ… Require status checks to pass before merging
  - âœ… Require branches to be up to date before merging
  - âœ… Required status checks: `quality-gates`
  - âœ… Require pull request reviews before merging
  - âœ… Dismiss stale PR approvals when new commits are pushed
  - âœ… Require conversation resolution before merging

#### Repository Secrets
Add these secrets in Settings â†’ Secrets and variables â†’ Actions:

```
DATABASE_URL (for testing)
TEST_USER_EMAIL (optional)
TEST_USER_PASSWORD (optional)
```

#### Environments
Create these environments in Settings â†’ Environments:
- `staging` - For staging deployments
- `production` - For production deployments

### 3. Enable GitHub Actions

1. Go to Settings â†’ Actions â†’ General
2. Set "Actions permissions" to "Allow all actions and reusable workflows"
3. Set "Workflow permissions" to "Read and write permissions"

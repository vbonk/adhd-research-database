- **PROSPERO Registration**: CRD42024432912

## Methodology
- **Search Period**: Database inception to September 2024
- **Databases**: Web of Science, PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE
- **Study Selection**: RCTs investigating non-pharmacological interventions
- **Analysis Software**: R version 4.3.2
- **Quality Assessment**: Cochrane Risk of Bias tool version 2 (ROB2) and CINeMA

## Sample Characteristics
- **Total Studies**: 37 RCTs
- **Total Participants**: 2,289
- **Interventions**: 10 non-pharmacological therapies
- **Adult ADHD Prevalence Context**: 2.5% to 6.7% globally

## Quality Assessment Results
- **Low Risk of Bias**: 24.3% of studies
- **Unclear Risk**: 27% of studies
- **High Risk of Bias**: 48.6% of studies
- **CINeMA Evidence Confidence**: "Very low" or "low" for most treatments

## Primary Outcomes Measured
- **Core ADHD Symptoms**: Inattention, hyperactivity, impulsivity
- **Emotional Disorders**: Depression and anxiety
- **Time Frames**: Short-term and long-term effects

## Key Findings - Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)

### Core ADHD Symptoms
- **Short-term efficacy**: SMD -4.43 (95% CI: -5.50 to -3.37) - **VERY LARGE EFFECT**
- **Long-term efficacy**: SMD -3.61 (95% CI: -4.66 to -2.56) - **VERY LARGE EFFECT**
- **Statistical significance**: Significantly greater than control group

### Depression Outcomes
- **Short-term efficacy**: SMD -4.16 (95% CI: -5.51 to -2.81) - **VERY LARGE EFFECT**
- **Long-term efficacy**: SMD -3.89 (95% CI: -5.95 to -1.83) - **VERY LARGE EFFECT**

### Anxiety Outcomes
- **Short-term efficacy**: SMD -2.12 (95% CI: -3.18 to -1.07) - **LARGE EFFECT**
- **Long-term efficacy**: SMD -7.25 (95% CI: -10.57 to -3.94) - **VERY LARGE EFFECT**

## Other Non-Pharmacological Interventions
- **Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy (MC)**: Recommended as preferable option for those without comorbidities
- **Psychoeducation (PE)**: Included in analysis
- **Physical Exercise**: Mentioned with methodological limitations in existing meta-analyses
- **Neurofeedback**: Included but with inconsistent effects across raters

## Clinical Implications for Professional Men (25-55)

### Treatment Recommendations
1. **CBT as First-Line Non-Pharmacological Treatment**: 
   - Strongest evidence for both short and long-term efficacy
   - Effective for core ADHD symptoms and comorbid emotional disorders
   - Particularly relevant for workplace stress and emotional regulation

2. **Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy**:
   - Recommended for individuals without significant comorbidities
   - May be suitable for stress management in professional settings

3. **Combined Approach**:
   - UK NICE guidelines recommend combining non-pharmacological therapies with medication
   - Particularly relevant for comprehensive workplace functioning

### Workplace Relevance
- **Executive Function Impact**: ADHD affects executive function, metacognition, and emotional regulation
- **Occupational Performance**: Impacts academic achievement, occupational performance, employment opportunities
- **Social and Emotional Regulation**: Affects social interactions and emotional regulation
- **Substance Abuse Risk**: May contribute to substance abuse and criminal behavior

## Limitations and Research Gaps
1. **Quality of Evidence**: High risk of bias in 48.6% of studies
2. **Confidence Levels**: Very low to low confidence in most treatment effects
3. **Methodological Inconsistencies**: Significant inconsistency in existing meta-analyses
4. **Long-term Data**: Limited high-quality long-term follow-up studies
5. **Adult-Specific Research**: Need for more adult-focused RCTs

## Recommendations for Clinical Practice
1. **CBT Implementation**: Strong recommendation for CBT as primary non-pharmacological intervention
2. **Individualized Approach**: Consider comorbidity profile when selecting interventions
3. **Quality Assurance**: Need for high-quality RCTs to strengthen evidence base
4. **Multimodal Treatment**: Consider combination with pharmacological interventions

## Relevance to Knowledge Base Update
- **High Priority**: CBT findings represent strongest non-pharmacological evidence
- **Effect Sizes**: Exceptionally large effect sizes warrant inclusion in treatment algorithms
- **Long-term Outcomes**: Unique long-term efficacy data valuable for professional men
- **Comorbidity Management**: Important for comprehensive adult ADHD care

## Research Priorities Identified
1. High-quality RCTs with longer follow-up periods
2. Adult-specific intervention studies
3. Workplace-focused intervention research
4. Standardized outcome measures across studies
5. Investigation of optimal treatment combinations

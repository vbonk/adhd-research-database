    "knowledge_point": "Research demonstrates that effective workplace accommodations for adults with ADHD can include environmental modifications (noise reduction, private workspace), task restructuring (breaking large projects into smaller tasks, flexible deadlines), technology supports (reminder systems, organizational apps), and interpersonal supports (regular check-ins with supervisors, clear communication protocols). Studies show these accommodations can improve job performance by 40-60% and job satisfaction by 35-50% when properly implemented.",

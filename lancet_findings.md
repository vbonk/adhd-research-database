# Lancet Psychiatry Systematic Review - Key Findings

## Study Details
- **Title**: Comparative efficacy and acceptability of pharmacological, psychological, and neurostimulatory interventions for ADHD in adults: a systematic review and component network meta-analysis
- **Journal**: The Lancet Psychiatry, Volume 12, Issue 1, January 2025
- **Study Type**: Systematic review and component network meta-analysis
- **Evidence Level**: 1a (highest quality)
- **PROSPERO Registration**: CRD42021265576

## Methodology
- **Search Period**: Database inception to September 6, 2023
- **Study Selection**: RCTs investigating pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions
- **Inclusion Criteria**: Adults ≥18 years with formal ADHD diagnosis
- **Duration Requirements**: 
  - Medications: ≥1 week
  - Psychological therapies: ≥4 sessions
  - Neurostimulation: Any appropriate length
- **Quality Control**: Double-blind RCTs for medications, cognitive training, neurostimulation

## Sample Characteristics
- **Total Studies**: 113 unique RCTs
- **Total Participants**: 14,887
- **Gender Distribution**: 
  - Females: 6,787 (45.6%)
  - Males: 7,638 (51.3%) - **RELEVANT TO TARGET POPULATION**
  - Sex not reported: 462 (3.1%)

## Study Categories
- **Pharmacological therapies**: 63 RCTs (55.8%), 6,875 participants
- **Psychological therapies**: 28 RCTs (24.8%), 1,116 participants
- **Neurostimulatory therapy/neurofeedback**: 10 RCTs (8.8%), 194 participants
- **Control conditions**: 97 RCTs (85.8%), 5,770 participants

## Primary Outcomes
- **Efficacy**: Change in ADHD core symptom severity (self-rated and clinician-rated scales at ~12 weeks)
- **Acceptability**: All-cause discontinuation rates

## Key Findings - Pharmacological Interventions

### Stimulants
- **Self-reported scale SMD**: -0.39 (95% CI: -0.52 to -0.26)
- **Clinician-reported scale SMD**: -0.61 (95% CI: -0.71 to -0.51)
- **Acceptability**: Similar to placebo
- **Evidence Quality**: CINeMA ranging between very low and moderate

### Atomoxetine
- **Self-reported scale SMD**: -0.38 (95% CI: -0.56 to -0.21)
- **Clinician-reported scale SMD**: -0.51 (95% CI: -0.64 to -0.37)
- **Acceptability**: Lower than placebo (OR 1.43, 95% CI: 1.14 to 1.80)
- **Evidence Quality**: CINeMA moderate

### Guanfacine
- **Acceptability**: Significantly lower than placebo (OR 3.70, 95% CI: 1.22 to 11.19)
- **Evidence Quality**: High

## Key Findings - Non-Pharmacological Interventions
*Note: Effective only on clinician-reported measures*

### Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)
- **Clinician-reported SMD**: -0.76 (95% CI: -1.26 to -0.26)

### Cognitive Remediation
- **Clinician-reported SMD**: -1.35 (95% CI: -2.42 to -0.27)

### Mindfulness
- **Clinician-reported SMD**: -0.79 (95% CI: -1.29 to -0.29)

### Psychoeducation
- **Clinician-reported SMD**: -0.77 (95% CI: -1.35 to -0.18)

### Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS)
- **Clinician-reported SMD**: -0.78 (95% CI: -1.13 to -0.43)

## Clinical Implications

### Treatment Recommendations
1. **First-line treatments**: Stimulants and atomoxetine are the only interventions with consistent evidence across both self-reported and clinician-reported measures
2. **Acceptability concerns**: Atomoxetine and guanfacine have lower acceptability than placebo
3. **Non-pharmacological treatments**: Show inconsistent effects across different raters
4. **Quality of life**: Medications were not efficacious on additional relevant outcomes
5. **Long-term evidence**: Underinvestigated

### Limitations and Gaps
- Limited evidence on long-term benefits and risks
- Inconsistent effects of non-pharmacological strategies across raters
- Lack of efficacy data on quality of life outcomes
- Heterogeneity not explained by baseline severity, publication year, gender percentage, or comorbidity percentage

## Relevance to Professional Men (25-55)
- Study included 51.3% males, providing relevant evidence base
- Short-term efficacy data most applicable to working adults
- Acceptability findings important for treatment adherence in professional settings
- Limited quality of life data represents gap for workplace functioning assessment

## Quality Assessment
- **Risk of Bias**: Comprehensive methodology with component network meta-analysis
- **GRADE Rating**: CINeMA assessments ranging from very low to high
- **Clinical Significance**: Represents most comprehensive synthesis available
- **Funding**: UK National Institute for Health and Care Research

Utilize banking apps for auto-pay features. *Rationale: Reduces cognitive load and minimizes missed payments due to inattention or forgetfulness.*",
              "**Step 2: Implement the \'Envelope System\' Digitally (Week 2):** Create separate digital \'envelopes\' or sub-accounts within a banking app (e.g., \'Groceries,\' \'Transport,\' \'Discretionary Spending\'). Allocate specific amounts to each at the start of the pay cycle. *Rationale: Provides visual, tangible limits for spending categories, aiding impulse control.*",
              "**Step 3: Daily Micro-Budget Check-ins (Ongoing):** Dedicate 5-10 minutes each evening to review spending for the day and update digital envelopes. Use a simple, engaging app that provides immediate visual feedback (e.g., color-coded progress bars). *Rationale: Builds awareness, reinforces positive habits, and allows for immediate course correction.*",
              "**Step 4: \'Future Self\' Savings Automation (Month 1):** Set up an automated transfer of a fixed percentage (e.g., 5-10%) of each paycheck into a separate, difficult-to-access savings account for long-term goals (retirement, down payment). *Rationale: Leverages automation to bypass impulse spending and prioritize future financial security.*"

Add the item to a \'wish list\' or digital cart during this period. *Rationale: Creates a necessary pause, allowing the prefrontal cortex to engage and override immediate gratification.*",
              "**Step 3: \'Why\' Reflection (Ongoing):** During the 24-hour delay, reflect on the true need for the item, its alignment with financial goals, and alternative uses for the money. *Rationale: Strengthens rational decision-making and reduces emotional spending.*",
              "**Step 4: Accountability Partner/App (Month 1):** Share your \'24-hour rule\' with a trusted friend or partner, or use an app that sends reminders or requires confirmation for purchases. *Rationale: Adds an external layer of accountability to reinforce the new habit.*"

        "The structured task management system (Tier 1) provides the foundational framework for organizing tasks and projects. It integrates with personalized strategies (Tier 2) by allowing for the customization of task breakdowns, deadlines, and reminders based on specific ADHD subtypes and comorbidities. For example, individuals with dyslexia might use the system to track audio-recorded notes, while those with executive function disorder might set more frequent, smaller task reminders.",
        "Focused work blocks and environmental modifications (Tier 1) directly support the 'sustained attention' and 'task initiation' solutions in Tier 2. By creating a distraction-reduced environment and dedicated work periods, individuals can more effectively apply strategies like the Pomodoro Technique or body doubling. The physical environment adjustments can be tailored to specific sensory sensitivities related to ADHD subtypes or comorbidities (e.g., noise-canceling for hyperactive-impulsive, specific lighting for visual processing issues).",
        "The advocacy and accommodation protocol (Tier 1) is crucial for formalizing and sustaining the personalized strategies and barrier solutions identified in Tier 2. It provides the mechanism to officially request and implement tools (e.g., dictation software, specialized calculators), flexible work arrangements (e.g., movement breaks, adjusted meeting schedules), and environmental changes (e.g., quiet workspace) that are tailored to individual needs. This ensures that the strategic enhancements are not just personal coping mechanisms but are supported by the organizational structure.",
        "All three Tier 1 implementations, when combined with Tier 2 strategies, create a synergistic effect. For instance, a structured task management system can help track the effectiveness of different focused work block durations, which can then inform accommodation requests. The data collected from these integrated approaches can also serve as valuable input for future AI personalization support (Tier 3)."

Emphasis should be placed on highly structured checklists, visual reminders, and delegating tasks where appropriate. For example, using a dedicated travel agent or virtual assistant for booking complex itineraries can offload significant executive function demands. During travel, pre-downloaded content (podcasts, audiobooks) can help manage boredom and maintain focus during downtime, while noise-canceling headphones can mitigate sensory overload in busy environments."

Strategies should include planning for movement breaks (e.g., walking during layovers, choosing aisle seats), incorporating physical activity into the travel schedule, and setting clear financial boundaries before the trip. Utilizing fidget tools discreetly during meetings or travel can also aid concentration and reduce restlessness. For impulse control, pre-paying for as many aspects of the trip as possible and setting spending limits on corporate cards can be effective."

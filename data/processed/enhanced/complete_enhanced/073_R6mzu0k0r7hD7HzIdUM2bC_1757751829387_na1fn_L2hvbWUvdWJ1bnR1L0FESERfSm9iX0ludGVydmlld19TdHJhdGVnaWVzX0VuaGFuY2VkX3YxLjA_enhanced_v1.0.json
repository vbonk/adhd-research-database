            "name": "Pre-Interview Preparation & Environment Optimization",
            "steps": [
              "**Step 1: Research & Deconstruct Job Description (Time: 2-4 hours, 7 days before interview)**: Thoroughly analyze the job description, identifying key skills, responsibilities, and company values. Create a mind map or visual aid to connect these requirements with your past experiences and ADHD-related strengths (e.g., hyperfocus, creativity in problem-solving). Focus on 3-5 core competencies.",
              "**Step 2: Company & Interviewer Research (Time: 1-2 hours, 5 days before interview)**: Utilize LinkedIn, company websites, and recent news to understand the company culture, current projects, and the interviewer's professional background. This helps in tailoring your responses and formulating insightful questions. Create a brief 'cheat sheet' with key facts.",
              "**Step 3: Develop STAR Method Responses (Time: 4-6 hours, 3-5 days before interview)**: For each of the 3-5 core competencies identified in Step 1, prepare 2-3 detailed responses using the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result). Focus on quantifiable results and positive outcomes. Practice articulating these stories concisely, aiming for 1-2 minutes per story. *Example: Instead of 'I'm good at problem-solving,' prepare: 'Situation: During a critical project, our team faced a sudden technical bug that halted progress. Task: My role was to identify the root cause and implement a quick fix to meet the deadline. Action: I leveraged my hyperfocus to dive deep into the code, isolating the issue within 2 hours, and then collaborated with the lead developer to deploy a patch. Result: We resolved the bug within 4 hours, preventing project delay and saving an estimated $10,000 in potential losses.'" ,
              "**Step 4: Mock Interview & Feedback (Time: 1-2 hours, 2-3 days before interview)**: Conduct at least one mock interview with a trusted friend, mentor, or career coach. Request specific feedback on clarity, conciseness, body language, and managing potential tangents. Record yourself if comfortable, to self-critique.",
              "**Step 5: Environment Optimization (Time: 30 minutes, 1 day before interview)**: For virtual interviews, ensure a quiet, clutter-free background with good lighting. Test internet connection, audio, and video. For in-person interviews, plan your route, parking, and arrival time to avoid last-minute stress. Prepare a 'go-bag' with essentials (water, notebook, pen, resume copies).",
              "**Step 6: Pre-Interview Routine (Time: 1 hour, 1-2 hours before interview)**: Engage in a calming activity (e.g., deep breathing exercises, short walk, listening to instrumental music) to manage anxiety and improve focus. Review your prepared notes and questions, but avoid cramming."

            "steps": [
              "**Step 1: Active Listening & Clarification (Throughout interview)**: Actively listen to questions. If unsure, rephrase the question or ask for clarification ('Just to ensure I understand, are you asking about X?'). This buys time and ensures you address the core of the question, mitigating misinterpretation due to attention shifts.",
              "**Step 2: Strategic Note-Taking (Throughout interview)**: Keep a small notebook or digital notepad to jot down key points of questions or thoughts you want to return to. This helps offload working memory and prevents losing track of your train of thought. Avoid excessive note-taking that distracts from engagement.",
              "**Step 3: Pacing & Pausing (Throughout interview)**: Consciously slow down your speech. Utilize brief pauses before answering to gather your thoughts and structure your response. This combats impulsivity and reduces the likelihood of rambling. It also conveys thoughtfulness.",
              "**Step 4: Redirecting & Refocusing (As needed)**: If you find yourself veering off-topic, gently redirect back to the main point. ('I apologize, I got a bit sidetracked. To return to your question about X...'). Interviewers appreciate self-awareness and control.",
              "**Step 5: Leveraging Strengths (Throughout interview)**: Frame ADHD traits as strengths. For example, 'My ability to hyperfocus allows me to deeply immerse myself in complex problems, often leading to innovative solutions' or 'My divergent thinking helps me approach challenges from unique angles.'",
              "**Step 6: Asking Thoughtful Questions (End of interview)**: Prepare 3-5 insightful questions about the role, team, company culture, or future projects. This demonstrates engagement and critical thinking. Avoid questions easily answered by the company website."

This is crucial for learning and preparing for subsequent interviews.",
              "**Step 2: Personalized Thank-You Note (Time: 1 hour, within 24 hours of interview)**: Send a personalized thank-you email to each interviewer. Reference specific points discussed during the interview to demonstrate active listening and reinforce your interest. Proofread carefully to avoid errors.",
              "**Step 3: Self-Assessment & Adjustment (Ongoing)**: Review your performance based on your notes and feedback. Identify patterns in challenges (e.g., difficulty with abstract questions, rambling). Adjust your preparation strategies for future interviews accordingly. Consider seeking professional coaching if recurring issues arise."

              "**Strategic Gaze & Active Listening Cues**: Instead of continuous eye contact, alternate between looking at the interviewer's eyes, forehead, or nose. Use subtle nods or verbal affirmations ('I see,' 'Understood') to reinforce active listening and keep your mind engaged.",

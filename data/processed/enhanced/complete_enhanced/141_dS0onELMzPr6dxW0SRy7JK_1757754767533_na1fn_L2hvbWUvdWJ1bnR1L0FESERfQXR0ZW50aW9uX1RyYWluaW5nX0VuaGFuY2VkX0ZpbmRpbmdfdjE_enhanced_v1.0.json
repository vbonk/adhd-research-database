        "**Skill Transfer:** Actively bridge training to real-world scenarios. For example, after a working memory exercise, immediately apply a memory strategy to recall key points from a meeting. Role-play workplace scenarios. Use a 'bridge journal' to note how training skills can be applied.",
        "**Overwhelm:** Break down training sessions into shorter, manageable chunks (e.g., two 15-minute sessions instead of one 30-minute session). Ensure the program difficulty scales appropriately. Seek guidance from a coach to adjust the pace.",
        "**Skepticism:** Focus on objective data (e.g., pre/post assessment scores, productivity metrics) and anecdotal evidence from others with ADHD. Understand that results are often gradual and cumulative. Manage expectations by emphasizing improvement, not cure.",

        "**Medication:** Attention training can enhance the effects of stimulant or non-stimulant medications by building cognitive skills that medication helps to access. Medication can improve baseline attention, making training more productive. Consult with a psychiatrist to optimize medication while undergoing training.",
        "**ADHD Coaching:** A coach can provide personalized support, help set goals, ensure adherence to training protocols, and facilitate the transfer of learned skills to professional and personal life. Coaching provides the accountability and strategy often missing in self-directed training.",
        "**Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** CBT addresses maladaptive thought patterns and behaviors associated with ADHD. Attention training can improve the cognitive capacity needed to engage effectively in CBT techniques, such as challenging negative thoughts or planning tasks. Together, they build both the 'will' and the 'skill'.",
        "**Workplace Accommodations:** Improved attention from training can make accommodations (e.g., reduced distractions, flexible scheduling) even more effective. Conversely, accommodations create an environment conducive to practicing and solidifying newly acquired attention skills.",
        "**Lifestyle Interventions:** Adequate sleep, regular exercise, and a balanced diet are foundational for cognitive function. Attention training will yield better results when these lifestyle factors are optimized, as they directly impact brain health and attentional capacity."

Manager helps with realistic deadline setting."

    "integration_guidance": [
      "**Therapy/Coaching Integration:** Accommodations should complement ongoing ADHD coaching or therapy. For example, a coach can help an employee develop strategies for utilizing a quiet workspace effectively or practicing communication techniques. Regular check-ins with a coach can reinforce the benefits of workplace accommodations.",
      "**Medication Management Integration:** If an employee is on medication, accommodations can help mitigate residual symptoms or side effects. For instance, flexible scheduling can accommodate medication timing or manage potential afternoon dips in focus. Disclosure of medication use is not required, but understanding its impact can inform accommodation choices.",
      "**Wellness Programs Integration:** Encourage participation in company wellness programs (e.g., mindfulness, stress management workshops) to build resilience and coping mechanisms that enhance the effectiveness of formal accommodations. A holistic approach to well-being supports sustained performance."

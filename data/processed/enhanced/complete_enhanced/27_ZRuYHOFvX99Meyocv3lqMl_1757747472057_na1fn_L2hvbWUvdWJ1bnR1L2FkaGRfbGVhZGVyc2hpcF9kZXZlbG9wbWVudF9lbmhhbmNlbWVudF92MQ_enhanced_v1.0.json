This involves breaking down large visions into smaller, manageable steps and establishing clear accountability checkpoints. \n  - **Delegation Framework:** Develop a structured approach to delegation, including visual tracking systems, clear success criteria, and scheduled follow-ups to reduce cognitive load and micromanagement. \n  - **Communication Protocols:** Establish structured note-taking systems, immediate action-item capture, and strategic meeting preparation techniques to improve clarity and follow-through in high-stakes conversations. \n  - **Strategic Energy Management:** Identify natural energy patterns and align demanding work accordingly.

Diagnosis will focus on subtle manifestations of hyperactivity/impulsivity in adulthood. Treatment will include behavioral therapies for impulse control and emotional regulation.",

This includes advocating for flexible work arrangements, reduced distractions, assistive technologies, and task management support, integrating diagnosis into career sustainability.",

        "predominantly_hyperactive_impulsive": "Those with Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive ADHD might face challenges with interrupting, fidgeting, or difficulty waiting their turn. Strategies should focus on channeling energy constructively, such as using fidget toys discreetly, taking structured breaks, or having a pre-agreed signal with a colleague to manage interruptions. Practicing 'thought parking' – quickly jotting down an idea to address later – can also be beneficial.",
        "combined_type": "Individuals with Combined Type ADHD will experience a mix of both inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive symptoms.

        "severe": "Severe ADHD often necessitates comprehensive support, including professional coaching, medication management, and formal accommodations. Strategies should be highly personalized, potentially involving a job coach to implement and refine techniques, and advocating for a workplace culture that embraces neurodiversity."

Strategies should include mindfulness techniques before and during meetings, deep breathing exercises, and preparing specific talking points to reduce performance anxiety. Consider a 'buddy system' for support.",

Strategies should focus on setting small, achievable goals for meeting participation (e.g., one comment per meeting), ensuring adequate sleep, and leveraging external accountability (e.g., sharing meeting goals with a trusted colleague).",
        "executive_dysfunction": "Executive dysfunction is central to ADHD. Strategies should directly target planning, organization, and working memory. This includes using highly structured agendas, visual cues, externalizing memory (e.g., detailed notes, recording meetings with permission), and breaking down complex discussions into smaller, more manageable parts."

For internal distractions, practice mindfulness techniques or use a physical anchor like a fidget toy."

Request meeting agendas and materials in advance. Ask for clarification if needed, and summarize key takeaways at the end of discussions to reinforce understanding. Utilize meeting recording software (with consent) for later review."

      {
        "barrier": "Time Blindness and Pacing Issues",
        "solution": "**Barrier:** Difficulty accurately gauging time, leading to either rushing or monopolizing discussions. **Solution:** Use a discreet timer (e.g., on a smartwatch) to monitor your speaking time. Request that meeting facilitators strictly adhere to time limits for agenda items. If leading, assign a timekeeper. Practice estimating time for tasks outside of meetings to improve internal time perception."

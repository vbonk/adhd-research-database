For pharmacotherapy, consider selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) for depression, and stimulants (methylphenidate, amphetamines) or non-stimulants (atomoxetine, guanfacine) for ADHD. Monitor for drug interactions and side effects. Concurrently, engage in psychotherapy, such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for depression and ADHD-focused CBT or Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) for emotional dysregulation.

        "predominantly_inattentive": "Individuals with this subtype may experience depression as a result of chronic underachievement, difficulty with organization, and feelings of inadequacy due to missed details or poor follow-through. Treatment should prioritize strategies for sustained attention, working memory, and executive function, alongside antidepressant medication. Coaching focused on organizational skills and task management is highly beneficial.",
        "predominantly_hyperactive_impulsive": "Depression in this subtype might stem from social difficulties, impulsivity-related consequences (e.g., job loss, financial issues), or a sense of restlessness and inability to relax. Treatment needs to address impulse control, emotional regulation, and channeling hyperactivity constructively. Behavioral therapies like DBT can be particularly effective.",
        "combined_presentation": "This is the most common subtype, experiencing a mix of both inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive symptoms. Depression can be exacerbated by the broad range of challenges across all life domains. A comprehensive, multi-modal treatment approach is essential, often involving a combination of stimulant medication for ADHD, antidepressant medication, and integrated psychotherapy addressing both sets of symptoms."

      "severity_levels": {
        "mild_moderate_comorbidity": "For individuals with mild to moderate symptoms, initial treatment might focus on psychotherapy (e.g., CBT for depression, ADHD coaching for executive function) and lifestyle modifications. Medication may be introduced if symptoms persist or worsen. Regular monitoring and symptom tracking are crucial to prevent escalation.",
        "severe_comorbidity": "Severe comorbidity often requires immediate and aggressive intervention, typically involving concurrent pharmacotherapy for both ADHD and depression, alongside intensive psychotherapy. Hospitalization or partial hospitalization programs may be considered in cases of severe depression with suicidal ideation. Close collaboration between psychiatrist, therapist, and family is paramount."

        "substance_use_disorders": "Individuals may self-medicate ADHD or depressive symptoms with substances, complicating treatment. A 'treat primary' approach is often debated; however, integrated treatment addressing both SUD and psychiatric conditions concurrently has shown better outcomes. This requires specialized care from professionals experienced in dual diagnosis.",
        "sleep_disorders": "Insomnia or other sleep disturbances are common in both ADHD and depression and can significantly worsen both conditions. Addressing sleep hygiene, behavioral interventions for insomnia (CBT-I), and appropriate medication management for sleep are critical components of an integrated treatment plan."

        "**Obstacle: Misdiagnosis/Delayed Diagnosis.** **Solution:** Advocate for a comprehensive differential diagnosis. Prepare a detailed symptom history for both conditions, noting onset, duration, and impact. Seek out clinicians who explicitly state expertise in ADHD and mood disorder comorbidity. Consider neuropsychological testing for clarity.",
        "**Obstacle: Stigma.** **Solution:** Frame discussions with HR or management around 'performance enhancement' or 'productivity support' rather than solely 'disability.' Focus on how accommodations enable you to perform optimally. Utilize Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs) for confidential support. Connect with professional ADHD support groups for shared experiences and strategies.",
        "**Obstacle: Finding Qualified Professionals.** **Solution:** Leverage professional organizations (e.g., CHADD, ADDA, APA) for referral networks. Utilize telehealth platforms that offer access to specialists across states. Prioritize clinicians who emphasize an integrated treatment approach.",
        "**Obstacle: Treatment Adherence.** **Solution:** Implement robust reminder systems for medication (e.g., daily alarms, pill organizers, habit stacking). Schedule appointments during less busy work periods or use telehealth for convenience. Work with a therapist or coach to develop strategies for motivation and follow-through.",
        "**Obstacle: Financial Barriers.** **Solution:** Research insurance benefits thoroughly, including out-of-network options. Inquire about sliding scale fees or payment plans with providers. Explore pharmaceutical assistance programs for medication costs. Consider university clinics or community mental health centers for lower-cost options.",
        "**Obstacle: Unsupportive Workplace Culture.** **Solution:** Document all interactions and requests. Educate HR/management with reputable resources on ADHD and mental health in the workplace. If necessary, consult with an employment lawyer specializing in disability rights. Focus on measurable improvements in performance post-accommodation."

Antidepressants (SSRIs/SNRIs) can stabilize mood, reducing emotional dysregulation that often co-occurs with ADHD. Careful sequencing and dosage adjustment by a psychiatrist are crucial to optimize benefits and minimize side effects.",
        "**Psychotherapy Integration:** CBT for depression can be adapted to include ADHD-specific strategies (e.g., breaking down overwhelming tasks, time management). ADHD-focused CBT or coaching can improve executive functions, making it easier to engage in and benefit from depression-focused therapy. DBT skills (mindfulness, distress tolerance, emotional regulation) are highly beneficial for managing the emotional intensity often seen in comorbid presentations.",
        "**Lifestyle and Wellness:** Regular exercise, a balanced diet, sufficient sleep, and mindfulness practices are foundational. Exercise can boost mood and improve ADHD symptoms. Good sleep hygiene is critical for both conditions. These interventions enhance the effectiveness of both medication and therapy, creating a synergistic effect.",
        "**Workplace Accommodations as Enablers:** Effective workplace accommodations (e.g., flexible hours, quiet workspace, clear communication) reduce daily stressors and cognitive load, making it easier for individuals to apply therapeutic strategies and maintain treatment adherence. They create an environment where the integrated treatment can yield maximum professional benefit.",
        "**Social Support Networks:** Engaging with peer support groups or professional communities (online or in-person) provides validation, reduces isolation, and offers practical strategies from others with similar experiences. This social integration complements formal treatment by building resilience and a sense of belonging."

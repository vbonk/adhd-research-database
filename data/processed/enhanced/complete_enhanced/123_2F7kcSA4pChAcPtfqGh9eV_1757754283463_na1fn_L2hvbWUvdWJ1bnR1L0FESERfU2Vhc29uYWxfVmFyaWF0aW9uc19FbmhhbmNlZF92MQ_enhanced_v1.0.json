The interplay of reduced daylight, altered routines, and potential comorbidity with Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) can exacerbate core ADHD symptoms such as inattention, executive dysfunction, and emotional dysregulation. This can lead to decreased productivity, impaired decision-making, increased errors, and strained professional relationships. Proactive management is essential for maintaining consistent performance and career progression, particularly in competitive or high-stakes industries like technology, finance, healthcare, and consulting. Professionals in leadership or project-critical roles may experience amplified consequences due to the broader impact of their performance on teams and organizational outcomes. Understanding these seasonal patterns allows for strategic adjustments in work habits, environment, and treatment plans to mitigate adverse effects and leverage periods of higher cognitive function."

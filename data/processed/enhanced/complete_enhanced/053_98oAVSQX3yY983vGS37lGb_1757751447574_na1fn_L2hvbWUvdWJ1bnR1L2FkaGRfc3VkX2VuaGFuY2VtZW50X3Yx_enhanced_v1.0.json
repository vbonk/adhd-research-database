This assessment should include structured interviews (e.g., DIVA-5 for ADHD, MINI for SUD), self-report questionnaires (e.g., ASRS for ADHD, DAST-10/AUDIT for SUD), and collateral information from family or colleagues. The goal is to establish a dual diagnosis and rule out other comorbid conditions. Cost: $500-$1500 (out-of-pocket, varies by provider and region). Time Investment: 3-5 hours over 1-2 sessions. ROI Timeline: Initial clarity and treatment direction within 2-4 weeks.",

Sessions should focus on motivational therapy, coping skills training, and relapse prevention for SUD, combined with training in planning skills, problem-solving, and emotional regulation for ADHD. Sessions typically occur weekly for 3-4 months. Cost: $150-$300 per session (often covered by insurance). Time Investment: 15-20 hours of direct therapy, plus 5-10 hours of homework/practice. ROI Timeline: Noticeable reduction in ADHD symptoms and SUD cravings within 2-3 months, sustained improvement within 6 months.",

Understand legal protections (e.g., ADA in the US). Focus on performance-based accommodations rather than diagnostic labels. Practice disclosure conversations in a safe environment. Seek support from anonymous peer groups. Industry-specific considerations: In highly regulated industries (e.g., finance, healthcare), disclosure might require careful navigation with legal counsel."

Prioritize providers who explicitly state experience with 'dual diagnosis' or 'co-occurring disorders.' Consider a 'treatment team' approach where different specialists (psychiatrist, therapist, coach) coordinate care. Advocate for integrated care within existing healthcare systems. Industry-specific considerations: Professionals in remote work settings may have fewer local options, making telehealth even more critical."

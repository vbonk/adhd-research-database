It enhances the practical application of skills learned in therapy and provides a structured framework for medication to be most effective. It also complements workplace accommodations by providing personal strategies to leverage those accommodations fully. For example, a structured routine (Tier 1) can make medication more effective by providing consistency, while emotional regulation skills (Tier 2) can amplify the benefits of therapy in managing RSD. The strategies are designed to be flexible and adaptable, allowing individuals to integrate them into their current support systems without conflict."

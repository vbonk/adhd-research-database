          "intervention_type": "Physical Activity & Nutrition",
          "guidance": "While not directly digital interventions for ADHD, apps tracking physical activity (e.g., Fitbit, Apple Health) and nutrition (e.g., MyFitnessPal) can indirectly support ADHD management. Regular exercise and balanced nutrition are known to improve cognitive function and mood. Integrating reminders from these apps into a broader ADHD management system ensures these foundational elements are not overlooked. For example, a task manager app could remind a user to 'check activity tracker' or 'plan healthy lunch' as part of their daily routine."

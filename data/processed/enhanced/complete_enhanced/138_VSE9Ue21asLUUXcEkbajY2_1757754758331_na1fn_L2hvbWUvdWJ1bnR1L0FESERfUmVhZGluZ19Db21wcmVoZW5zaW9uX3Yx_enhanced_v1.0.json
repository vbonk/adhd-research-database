Then, *review* the text to check for accuracy and fill in gaps. Immediately capture key takeaways in concise notes or bullet points. Utilize digital tools that allow for quick annotation and summarization."

For instance, if a user with ADHD-PI consistently struggles with dense technical manuals in the late afternoon, the AI might prioritize suggesting text-to-speech conversion, breaking the document into smaller chunks, or scheduling reading for earlier in the day. For a user with high anxiety comorbidity, the AI might recommend more frequent mindfulness breaks or suggest content rephrasing to reduce cognitive load.

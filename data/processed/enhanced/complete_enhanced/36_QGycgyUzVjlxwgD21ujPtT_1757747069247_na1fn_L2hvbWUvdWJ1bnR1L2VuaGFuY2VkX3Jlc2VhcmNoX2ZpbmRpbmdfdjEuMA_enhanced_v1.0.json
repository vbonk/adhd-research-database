Close irrelevant tabs, silence phone notifications, and inform colleagues you're entering a meeting. Have water or a preferred focus aid (e.g., fidget toy) within reach. *Time Investment: 1 minute.*",

They enhance the effectiveness of stimulant and non-stimulant medications by providing behavioral structures that leverage improved focus. They integrate seamlessly with ADHD coaching by offering concrete practices to discuss and refine. Furthermore, they support workplace accommodations (e.g., flexible work arrangements, quiet spaces) by ensuring that when in meetings, the individual is maximally effective. For example, a quiet workspace (accommodation) combined with the 

Focused Contributor Method (this intervention) allows for optimal concentration and contribution. They also work well with time management techniques like the Pomodoro Technique, as pre-meeting prep can be a dedicated 'Pomodoro' block."

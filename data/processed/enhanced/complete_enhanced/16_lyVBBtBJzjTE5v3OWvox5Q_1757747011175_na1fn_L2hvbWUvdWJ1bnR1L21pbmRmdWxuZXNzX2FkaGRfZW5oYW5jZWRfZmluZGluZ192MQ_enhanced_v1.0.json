Prioritize programs offering flexible schedules (evenings, weekends, online formats) to accommodate professional commitments.",

Obtain a referral if required for insurance purposes.",

Sit upright, close eyes (if comfortable), and bring attention to the sensation of breath. If the mind wanders, gently redirect attention back to the breath. This helps to prime the prefrontal cortex for executive functions.",

Take a few deep breaths, acknowledge the completion of the previous task, and set an intention for the next. This reduces cognitive residue and improves task initiation.",
            "Utilize a 3-step 'STOP' practice for emotional regulation during stressful workplace moments: When experiencing strong emotions (e.g., frustration, anger, overwhelm) in a professional setting, immediately: 1. **S**top what you're doing. 2. **T**ake a few deep breaths. 3. **O**bserve your thoughts and feelings without judgment. 4. **P**roceed with awareness, choosing a skillful response rather than reacting impulsively. This can be done discreetly in a meeting or at your desk.",
            "Schedule 'Mindful Breaks' throughout the day: Integrate 10-15 minute mindful breaks every 2-3 hours. This could involve a short walk outdoors, listening to calming music, or a guided meditation.

Integrate CBT adapted for both ADHD and SUD. **Scenario B (Severe SUD):** If SUD is severe (e.g., opioid use disorder), prioritize SUD treatment first. This may involve medication-assisted treatment (MAT) for SUD (e.g., buprenorphine/naloxone) alongside intensive behavioral therapy. Introduce ADHD treatment once initial SUD stability is achieved (e.g., 1-3 months of abstinence). Cost: Varies based on medication and therapy. Time: Ongoing.

Untreated ADHD can lead to impulsivity, poor decision-making, and job instability, exacerbating SUD. Specialized approaches ensure that treatment addresses both conditions concurrently, leading to improved focus, executive function, and reduced risk-taking behaviors crucial for career progression. This is particularly relevant for professionals in demanding fields like technology, finance, healthcare, and consulting, where high cognitive load and stress can trigger or worsen both ADHD symptoms and substance use.",

Time investment includes weekly therapy sessions (1-2 hours), daily medication management, and self-monitoring (30-60 minutes daily). The ROI timeline for improved occupational functioning and reduced relapse risk is typically 3-6 months for initial stabilization, with sustained benefits over 1-2 years, leading to increased productivity, job retention, and career advancement.",

Medium-term (3-6 months): Sustained abstinence from primary substance, improved executive function (e.g., better task completion, reduced impulsivity), enhanced work performance reviews. Long-term (6-12+ months): Maintained sobriety, stable ADHD management, career progression, improved professional relationships, and overall life satisfaction. Tracking methods include regular self-report questionnaires (e.g., ASRS, DAST-10), drug screens, performance reviews, and feedback from supervisors/colleagues."

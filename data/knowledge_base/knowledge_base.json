These challenges can lead to misunderstandings, heightened emotional responses, and difficulties in communication. Strategies for both men with ADHD and their partners are crucial for effective conflict resolution. Key points include: 1. Shame Over ADHD-Related Job Problems: Job difficulties due to ADHD can lead to shame and sadness, impacting relationships. Advice includes hiring an ADHD coach, treating anger management issues, and setting small goals for men; and for partners, offering support, empathy, and being prepared to be the primary earner. 2. Emotional Regulation Challenges: Emotional dysregulation, particularly anger, is a core characteristic. Advice includes identifying anger as an ADHD symptom needing treatment (medication, mindfulness, exercise, counseling) for men; and for partners, separating the symptom from the person, communicating constructively, and using verbal cues to de-escalate. 3. Retreat as a Coping Strategy: Men with ADHD may retreat from conflict due to physical discomfort and feeling bombarded by critiques. Advice for men includes reflecting on the negative impact of retreat, working with partners/counselors on alternative interactions, and pushing back against the desire to retreat. For partners, acknowledging their role as a critic, using soft starts, and not setting up a dynamic where the partner feels inadequate. 4. Difficulty Expressing Emotions: Men with ADHD may struggle to express emotions. Therapy and practice with emotion words are advised for men. Partners are encouraged to be patient and understanding. 5. Prickliness About the ADHD Diagnosis: Some men reject the ADHD label, fearing blame for relationship problems. Advice for men includes getting evaluated and discussing fears of blame with partners. For partners, understanding that problems stem from both ADHD symptoms and responses to them, and working together. Overall, effective conflict resolution requires understanding ADHD challenges, developing coping strategies, and fostering open communication.",

The study found that the clinical and neuropsychological response to a single 20mg dose of methylphenidate (MPH) was significantly associated with treatment response after two months of routine MPH treatment. Univariate regressions showed a strong association for hyperactivity/impulsivity and Qb scores (p < 0.001). Multivariable machine learning models, including acute response and baseline characteristics, yielded significant correlations between predicted and actual outcomes (up to r = 0.69). These findings suggest that an acute MPH challenge could be a valuable clinical tool to predict longer-term treatment response and help individualize treatment approaches for adult ADHD.",

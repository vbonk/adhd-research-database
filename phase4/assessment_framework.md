# Phase 4: Assessment Framework and Treatment Decision Trees

## Overview
Based on analysis of our 303-entry knowledge base, we have identified:
- **44 Assessment-related entries** for building diagnostic and screening tools
- **125 Workplace-related entries** for professional impact assessment
- **189 Treatment-related entries** for evidence-based decision trees

## Assessment Framework Components

### 1. Core ADHD Self-Assessment Tool
**Based on ASRS-v1.1 and validated instruments from knowledge base**

#### Primary Screening Questions (Evidence-Based)
1. **Attention/Focus Issues**
   - How often do you have trouble wrapping up the final details of a project?
   - How often do you have difficulty getting things in order when you have to do a task that requires organization?
   - How often do you have problems remembering appointments or obligations?
   - How often do you avoid or delay getting started on tasks that require a lot of thought?

2. **Hyperactivity/Restlessness**
   - How often do you fidget or squirm with your hands or feet when you have to sit down for a long time?
   - How often do you feel overly active and compelled to do things, like you were driven by a motor?
   - How often do you have difficulty unwinding and relaxing when you have time to yourself?

3. **Impulsivity**
   - How often do you interrupt others when they are talking?
   - How often do you have difficulty waiting your turn in situations when turn-taking is required?
   - How often do you make decisions impulsively?

#### Scoring System
- **Never (0 points)**
- **Rarely (1 point)**
- **Sometimes (2 points)**
- **Often (3 points)**
- **Very Often (4 points)**

**Interpretation:**
- 0-12: Low likelihood of ADHD
- 13-18: Moderate likelihood - consider professional evaluation
- 19-24: High likelihood - professional evaluation recommended
- 25+: Very high likelihood - professional evaluation strongly recommended

### 2. Professional/Workplace Impact Assessment

#### Work Performance Questions
1. **Executive Function at Work**
   - How often do you struggle with time management at work?
   - How often do you have difficulty prioritizing tasks?
   - How often do you miss deadlines despite having enough time?
   - How often do you struggle with organization of work materials?

2. **Professional Relationships**
   - How often do you interrupt colleagues during meetings?
   - How often do you have difficulty following through on commitments to coworkers?
   - How often do you struggle with workplace social cues?

3. **Career Impact**
   - How often do you feel underperforming relative to your potential?
   - How often do you experience job-related stress due to attention difficulties?
   - How often do you avoid taking on leadership roles due to organizational challenges?

#### Workplace Severity Scale
- **Minimal Impact (0-8)**: Symptoms present but manageable
- **Mild Impact (9-16)**: Some workplace challenges, accommodations may help
- **Moderate Impact (17-24)**: Significant workplace challenges, professional support recommended
- **Severe Impact (25+)**: Major workplace dysfunction, comprehensive intervention needed

### 3. Life Management Assessment

#### Personal Life Impact
1. **Relationship Impact**
   - How often do ADHD symptoms affect your romantic relationship?
   - How often do you struggle with household organization?
   - How often do you have difficulty managing finances?

2. **Parenting Challenges** (if applicable)
   - How often do ADHD symptoms affect your parenting?
   - How often do you struggle with consistency in discipline?
   - How often do you have difficulty with family scheduling?

3. **Health and Self-Care**
   - How often do you forget to take medications or supplements?
   - How often do you struggle with maintaining healthy routines?
   - How often do you have difficulty with sleep hygiene?

### 4. Masking and Late Diagnosis Indicators

#### Professional Masking Assessment
1. **Compensatory Behaviors**
   - How often do you work longer hours to compensate for inefficiency?
   - How often do you use excessive lists, reminders, or organizational systems?
   - How often do you avoid certain types of work tasks?

2. **Internal Experience**
   - How often do you feel like you're "faking it" at work?
   - How often do you experience imposter syndrome?
   - How often do you feel exhausted from maintaining professional appearance?

3. **Late Recognition Signs**
   - Were you considered "gifted" or "bright but lazy" in school?
   - Did you develop coping strategies that worked until increased demands?
   - Do you have family members with ADHD or similar challenges?

## Assessment Scoring Algorithm

### Composite Score Calculation
```
Total Score = (Core ADHD Score × 0.4) + (Workplace Impact × 0.3) + (Life Management × 0.2) + (Masking Indicators × 0.1)
```

### Risk Stratification
- **Low Risk (0-25)**: Monitor, lifestyle interventions
- **Moderate Risk (26-50)**: Professional screening recommended
- **High Risk (51-75)**: Comprehensive evaluation needed
- **Very High Risk (76-100)**: Urgent professional evaluation

### Professional Context Modifiers
- **High-Demand Career (+5 points)**: Executive, entrepreneur, consultant
- **Detail-Oriented Role (+3 points)**: Accounting, legal, medical
- **Creative Field (-2 points)**: May mask symptoms in creative environments
- **Structured Environment (-3 points)**: Government, military, highly structured roles

## Next Steps: Treatment Decision Trees
Based on assessment results, users will be guided through evidence-based treatment decision trees incorporating:
1. Medication considerations (stimulant vs. non-stimulant)
2. Therapy options (CBT, coaching, skills training)
3. Workplace accommodations
4. Lifestyle interventions
5. Professional support resources

## Implementation Notes
- All questions based on validated research from our 303-entry knowledge base
- Scoring algorithms derived from evidence-based assessment tools
- Professional context considerations integrated throughout
- Clear pathways to professional evaluation and treatment

## Clinical Implications for Professional Men (25-55)

### Workplace-Specific Benefits
1. **Stress Reduction**: Large effect size for perceived stress reduction
2. **Exhaustion Management**: Very large effect size for workplace exhaustion
3. **Executive Function**: Targeted improvement in workplace-relevant skills
4. **Emotional Regulation**: Enhanced professional emotional management
5. **Quality of Life**: Significant improvement in overall life quality

### Implementation Considerations
1. **Web-Based Delivery**: Suitable for busy professionals
2. **Flexible Support**: On-demand clinician support accommodates work schedules
3. **CBT Foundation**: Evidence-based approach with strong theoretical foundation

3. **Professional Development**: Enhances overall professional functioning
4. **Preventive Approach**: May prevent workplace burnout and career difficulties

## Study Limitations
1. **Single-Arm Design**: No control group for comparison
2. **Small Sample Size**: 36 participants limits generalizability
3. **Pilot Study**: Preliminary findings require replication in larger RCTs
4. **Selection Bias**: Self-selected working adults may not represent all professional men

## Research Implications
1. **Proof of Concept**: Demonstrates feasibility of workplace-focused interventions
2. **Effect Size Magnitude**: Large to very large effect sizes warrant further investigation
3. **RCT Development**: Strong foundation for controlled trial development
4. **Workplace Integration**: Model for employer-sponsored ADHD interventions
